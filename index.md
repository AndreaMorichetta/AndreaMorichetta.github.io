# Personal page

## Introduction
I am Andrea Morichetta.

I am a researcher. Currently, I'm in my last year of Ph.D., in Politecnico di Torino. I believe in learning as well as in my infinite ignorance.
I love thinking, and sometimes I over-do it. I like to write notes about my life and imagine stories.

My current profession allowed me to travel regularly. I had, and I still have, the opportunity to visit new places, enjoying both having a glimpse with some of them and being intimate with (few) others.

I like the sensations that new discoveries transmit, and I desire to get them in different aspects of my life.

## Research
I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Telecommunication Network Group](https://www.telematica.polito.it) of Politecnico di Torino. I joined the group in March 2016 with a scholarship, and later that year, started my doctorate. I work under the supervision of [Prof. Marco Mellia](https://www.telematica.polito.it/member/marco-mellia/), with a grant fully funded by the [Big-DAMA project](https://bigdama.ait.ac.at). My research focus is on data analysis and machine learning, with particular attention on unsupervised methodologies, applied to networks, with an accent on security and network traffic characterization.

1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
